Mecobo user manual

- At a glance - 
The system consists of three units; the thrift server, the thrift client and
the board. The server runs on a host computer that has the board connected to
it, and the client communicates with the server via an internet socket.

Usage is as simple as:
1 - Plug in the board. Any recent linux kernel has a ACM driver compiled in. As
such you can simply plug in a powered-on (and preconfigured) board. On Windows
you will have to use the provided .ini file and install that as a driver to
enable communication.
2 - Start the Thrift server binary.
3 - Connect to the Thrift server with a Thrift client and send commands to it
using the Thrift interface.

There is a section below on setting up the thrift server; and you can of course
recompile and modify it as you see fit-- however the current implementation should
suffice for simple stuff.

- User Guide -
To start the server, place yourself in the directory of the server binary
(usually called winHost), and run it from the command line with:

~> winHost.exe -f

The -f causes the server to look for mecobo.bin, which is the FPGA bitfile,
and program itself with it. 

>> NOTE! This is also how you restart the server <<

Now that the server is running on a computer that has the board connected to
it, talking to the board consists of calling the functions described in the
thrift interface description file, NascenseAPI_v01d.thrift. You also need to
generate the code that talks to the server. This is done with the thrift tool.

As an example, here is how you create a client in python:

oddrune @ crabcatcher:~$ thrift --gen py NascenseAPI_v01d.thrift

This gives me a directory called gen-py, that again contains a subdirectory NascenseAPI_v01d.
My python client looks like this:

oddrune @ crabcatcher:~$ cat client.py

import sys
sys.path.append('gen-py/NascenseAPI_v01d/')
import emEvolvableMotherboard
from ttypes import *

try:
  transport = TSocket.TSocket('dmlab02.idi.ntnu.no', 9090)
  transport = TTransport.TBufferedTransport(transport)

  prot = TBinaryProtocol.TBinaryProtocol(transport)
  cli = emEvolvableMotherboard.Client(prot);
  transport.open();

  cli.ping();

  transport.close();

except Thrift.TException, tx:
  print tx


That's all there is to it. It's similar in most languages and the apache thrift
wiki has more examples. 

- Using the Nascence interface -
Note that all of the examples here are done using python; but it's analogous to
other languages such as C#, C++, perl, ... 

The idea behind the interface is that of a sequencer. Using the function
appendSequenceAction(emSequenceItem) you append an item that performs a certain action.
The emSequenceItem is defined in the interface as well.

Example:
----------------------------------------------------------
it = emSequenceItem()
it.pin = 12;
it.startTime = 42;
it.endTime = 100;
it.amplitude = 1;
it.operationType = emSequenceOperationType().CONSTANT;
client.appendSequenceAction(it)
----------------------------------------------------------

This example creates a sequnce item and appends it to the sequence queue. The output will be -5 Volts on pin 12, if the daughterboard is connected.

Calling client.runSequences() initiates this sequence, and starts the clock at
time = 0. All times referred to in the emSequenceItems are relative to this t,
and time is measured in ms. 

Another frequenctly used operationType is RECORD:

----------------------------------------------------------
rec = emSequenceItem();
rec.pin = 10;
rec.starttime = 0;
rec.endTime = 1000;
rec.frequency = 5000;
rec.operationType = emSequenceOperationType().RECORD;
client.appendSequenceAction(rec)
----------------------------------------------------------

This will set up pin 10 as a recording pin, which will start recording at t=0, and end at t=1000 at a 
sample frequency of 5Khz.  Doing:

----------------------------------------------------------
recording = cli.getRecording(recordPin);
----------------------------------------------------------

will get you a buffer of the sampled data of about 5000 elements.

If you in addition the above specify 

rec.waveformType = emWaveFormType::PWM 

you will get a digital recording pin,
which only returns a buffer consisting of 1 or 0, depending on if the sampled
signal crossed the threshold for the FPGA input buffer, usually around 2.5V. 

- Other operationTypes - 

DIGITAL
----------------------------------------------------------
it = emSequenceItem();
it.pin = 0;
it.startTime = 1;
it.endTime = 1000;
it.frequency = 500;
it.cycleTime = 25;  #PERCENTAGE HIGH
it.operationType = emSequenceOperationType::type::DIGITAL;
----------------------------------------------------------

This will set up pin 0 to play a square wave with a cycle time of (1/500)s, of
wich 25% of the cycle will have the pin set to logical 1, for 1 second starting
at t=1.

CONSTANT_FROM_REGISTER:
----------------------------------------------------------
it = emSequenceItem();
it.pin = 0;
it.startTime = 1;
it.endTime = -1;
it.regNr = 3
it.operationType = emSequenceOperationType::type::CONSTANT_FROM_REGISTER;
----------------------------------------------------------

This sets up a sequence item that will not until the board is reset (endtime
-1), and whose output depends on the value one writes with the command
client.setRegister(register, value). 


- Without the daughterboards connected -
There are 45 digital channels that can be programmed individually on header WEST.

- With the analogue daughterboard connected -
If you have the daughterboard plugged in, it's good to let the server know this by adding a -d <number of daughterboards in the stack> to the server startup command. This will enable the DAC and ADC channels, and also redefine the pinouts somewhat. 

Each daughterboard has 16 pins. The daughterboards are stackable, and the name/number (used in the sequence item) is counted from the pin designated as 1 on the board towards pin 47, from 0 to 15. For board two this is pin 16 to 31, and so on.

For each group of 16 daugherboard pins the following restrictions apply (mecobo will let you know when you break them, but it's healthier for your code if you don't)
 - Max 8 analogue inputs.
 - Max 8 analogue outputs.

In addition, you can mix in 16 digital channels throughout the stack.

For one daughterboard this is a valid config 

0    1.2V
1    RA(record analogue)
2    4.5V
3    RA
4    3.3V

- Getting the Thrift server running -
The thrift server implements a high-level interface, described in
NascenseAPI_v01d.thrift which you can find in the API folder of our shared
Dropbox (same directory as this file). The thrift tool (which you get when you
install the thrift-package in linux or Windows) reads this interface
description and generates a skeleton server file that we have implemented. This
particular implementation of the server talks to the "Mecobo" motherboard. You
simply run this server, and it will start a service that listens for incoming
socket connections on port 9090.


- Upgrading the platform (i.e. when Odd Rune gives you a new mecobo_uc_vXX.bin) -
There are unfortunately still a few prerequisites when it comes to upgrading the platform.

Instructions for windows:
You’ll need to download Simplicity Studio:
 
	http://www.silabs.com/Support%20Documents/Software/simplicity-studio.exe

Once downloaded, run it (I believe this might require Administrator privileges, which may 
or may not be a problem for computers administrated by a certain IT dept.). You’ll only need to
install the ‘Energy Aware Commander’, or eAcommander as it is also called. 
Sometimes eCommander does not install properly. Press update button of simplicity studio for latest update.

Download and install device driver from website.

After you’ve installed the application, it’s time to open up the black box and connect a mini-USB cable
from your PC to the smaller of the two boards inside of the box. Note that there are two possible connection 
points. Use the one on the short side of the board, marked with DEBUG.

Power on the box.

Launch eAcommander from within simplicity studio. Make sure «J-Link device» is set to S/N <some number>. 

Hit ‘Connect’ in the top left corner. 

Select Debug Mode: «out».

On the leftmost column, select «Flash».

Once there, select «Browse» and navigate to the mecobo_uc_vXX.bin file you with to apply. Make sure «Reset EFM32 after flashing» is checked, and then hit «Flash EFM32».

Then disconnect recently connecte cables and connect back old one.

Turn off the board, restart the server (make sure the FPGA gets programmed) and start running experiments again!


- Technical description -
Mecobo consists of one EFM32GG990 microcontroller which acts as a ACM USB slave
